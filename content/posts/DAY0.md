Today marks the beginning of my "Two Powers Challenge." I delved into the realms of AVL trees and segment trees, expanding my knowledge in these areas. Concurrently, I embarked on "The One Thing," a book that advocates for narrowing focus onto a single, crucial task. Extraordinary results, it asserts, hinge on the ability to concentrate deeply on one thing at a time. Each day, realign your priorities, identify the most crucial task (the "lead domino"), and relentlessly pursue it until you achieve success. Consistency, not complexity, is the key to success, and it is built up step by step.

Success is not a solitary journey; it requires finding a supportive community or mentor. Identify your singular passion and skill, making it the cornerstone of your pursuit, much like Apple did with its products such as the iMac, iPhone, and now the Vision Pro. The essence of achieving extraordinary results lies in focusing on one thing at a time, a task made difficult by our tendency to commit to too many things. Instead of creating to-do lists, aim to compile success lists.

The book outlines six misconceptions that obstruct the path to success:

1. **Everything matters equally:** In reality, some tasks are more impactful than others.
2. **Multitasking:** Contrary to popular belief, focusing on one task at a time yields better results.
3. **A disciplined life:** While discipline is essential, it's not about being rigid but about aligning actions with goals.
4. **Willpower is always on will call:** Willpower is exhaustible, and managing it effectively is crucial.
5. **A balanced life:** Success often requires prioritizing certain aspects of life over others.
6. **Big is bad:** Big goals are not inherently problematic; the key is breaking them down into manageable chunks.
